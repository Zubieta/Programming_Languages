#Programming Languages
This is one of the following courses to *Introduction to Computer Science*, which dealt mostly in **Java**. This course introduced the use of **C++** and other important Computer Science concepts more directly related to programming languages themselves and their functioning rather than coding styles or how to code. All this was done for educational purposes in **Java** and **C++**, and is licensed under the **MIT License**.

###Course Project - Expert Waiter
This is an expert system done in **Java**, which is a GUI for a restaurant which helps waiters to manage the different charges for the users, and helps users to select what they want to buy according to parameters such as money limit, or calory intake limit, saving time on orders. After setting a limit on money or calory intake (or both or none), the user will go on making its order, and decreasing the respective values from the total available so that the order never exceeds the limit and items become restricted when the limits are reached.

###Pre-Project
Before the project, a lexical analyser was made so that text queries where made asked for price, total calory intake or both values, for whatever combination of ingredients or items made in the order, or asking for all the possible combinations of orders putting limits on money, on calory intake, or strictly including or excluding a certain items.
